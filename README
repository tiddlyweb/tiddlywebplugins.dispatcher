A TiddlyWeb plugin to dispatch tiddlers to asynchronous job queues.

This plugin uses beanstalkd to provide an in memory queing system
holding queues to external processes which will do something with
the information in the queue. The general goal is to allow processing
of tiddlers asynchronously: For example to do indexing, send mail,
etc.

The general model goes as follows:

* In init() of the plugin two things happen:
** a Store HOOK for tiddler put and delete is registered, that hooke has
   one job: put a message in the default queue of beanstalkd
** N+1 external process are either forked or if launched by some other
   mechanism, registered. The '1' processs listens on the default
   queue and writes the tiddler ID into a queue named after each of
   the N external processes (e.g. a tube named 'index')

* Each of the process listening on non-default tubes, processes
  the tiddler, and then deletes it from the queue.

This is _highly_ experimental. You will need to be able to compile
beanstalkd in order to use this.

External requirements are:
